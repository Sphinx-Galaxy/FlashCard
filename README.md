# FlashCard

A very smart vocabulary trainer

# Usage

Start the application and load a vocabulary file (look example.txt). The application will then ask randomly the flashcards. 

## Progress

The progress you make will be saved in levels. Every correct answer increases the flashcards level by one. However if you make a mistake, the level gets reset.

The levels themselves get translated into a "timestamp", meaning that the time between queries increases non-linearly.

After you reach a certain level, the question-answer scheme will be swapped.
